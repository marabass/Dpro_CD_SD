## Model Species

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
- In most species of *Drosophila*, females are larger than males
- However, in *D. prolongata*, it is reversed
:::
::: {.column}
```{r fig.cap = "***(a)** Male and **(b)** female* Drosophila prolongata *adapted from Setoguchi et al. (2014)*"}

## Experiment
:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
### Treatment
- 27 species from *D. melanogaster* species group used
  - Our analysis just focuses on *D. prolongata*
- Each group was exposed to increasing periods of starvation during larval development

:::
::: {.column}
### Hypothesis
- It was predicted that traits and species that were more sexually dimorphic would be more condition dependent than those that were less dimorphic
:::
::::::::::::::


## *Drosophila prolongata* Initial Observations
:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
- *D. prolongata* has strong sexual dimorphism in tibia and tarsus size
  - despite this, they are only moderately condition dependent
  - all other species in the experiment exhibited moderate dimorphism and condition dependence
:::
::: {.column}
- This leads us to a couple new hypotheses to investigate concerning *D. prolongata*
  1. Starvation during larval development will decrease sexual dimorphism in forelegs
  2. More sexually dimorphic traits (forelegs) will exhibit more condition dependence than less dimorphic traits (wings)

## Proposed Analyses
- Perform PCA analysis or log2 scaling to control for shape variation
  - will allow us to investigate size without the influence of shape
  - log2 scaling seems to be the easier option
