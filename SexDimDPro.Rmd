## Model Species

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
- In most species of *Drosophila*, females are larger than males
- However, in *D. prolongata*, it is reversed
:::
::: {.column}
```{r fig.cap = "***(a)** Male and **(b)** female* Drosophila prolongata *adapted from Setoguchi et al. (2014)*"}

## Experiment
:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
### Treatment
- 27 species from *D. melanogaster* species group used
  - Our analysis just focuses on *D. prolongata*
- Each group was exposed to increasing periods of starvation during larval development

:::
::: {.column}
### Hypothesis
- It was predicted that traits and species that were more sexually dimorphic would be more condition dependent than those that were less dimorphic
