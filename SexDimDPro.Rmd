## Model Species

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
- In most species of *Drosophila*, females are larger than males
- However, in *D. prolongata*, it is reversed
:::
::: {.column}
```{r fig.cap = "***(a)** Male and **(b)** female* Drosophila prolongata *adapted from Setoguchi et al. (2014)*"}

## Experiment
:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
### Treatment
- 27 species from *D. melanogaster* species group used
  - Our analysis just focuses on *D. prolongata*
- Each group was exposed to increasing periods of starvation during larval development

:::
::: {.column}
### Hypothesis
- It was predicted that traits and species that were more sexually dimorphic would be more condition dependent than those that were less dimorphic
:::
::::::::::::::


## *Drosophila prolongata* Initial Observations
:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
- *D. prolongata* has strong sexual dimorphism in tibia and tarsus size
  - despite this, they are only moderately condition dependent
  - all other species in the experiment exhibited moderate dimorphism and condition dependence
:::
::: {.column}
- This leads us to a couple new hypotheses to investigate concerning *D. prolongata*
  1. Starvation during larval development will decrease sexual dimorphism in forelegs
  2. More sexually dimorphic traits (forelegs) will exhibit more condition dependence than less dimorphic traits (wings)

## Proposed Analyses
- Perform PCA analysis
  - will allow us to investigate size without the influence of shape
- log2 scaling
  - allows us to investigate proportional size differences instead of absolute

## Principal Components Analysis
```{r Principal Components}
Dprol_PC <- prcomp(Dprol_trait_size_log)
PC_loadings <- Dprol_PC$rotation
```

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
```{r fig.cap = "*PC1 accounts for most of the variation we see*"}
ggplot(Dprol_size, aes(y = Dprol_PC$x[,1], x = Dprol_PC$x[,2], col = condition)) +
  geom_point() +
  #xlim(-5, 0.5) +
  #ylim(-0.5, 0.5) +
  labs(x = "PC1 (92.7%)", y = "PC2 (7.2%)")
```
