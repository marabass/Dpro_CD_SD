Not really the right kind of comment, but the “equivalent cost” argument seems like a weak and unnecessary link it what is otherwise a pretty straightforward argument. Not trying to engage with whether it has a value, but I think it's deeper and doesn't need to be in this overview.

There is nothing wrong with converting to μm – but if it actually simplifies your interpretation of anything, you're doing something wrong. Correct ways of interpreting the logged values should never lead to that sort of problem (and if you are sure it did, there's something to fix).

What happened to cohorts 2 and 3?

I vote against using “units” for fly id. The plural and the name both seem confusing. “id” or “fly”?

It's a smart idea to use lm as a sanity check, but I don't understand why you're looking at or thinking about the P values or CIs from that model... I wrote that before I saw your “proper effect sizes” claim. Somebody is confused here, but maybe it's me?

Putting “non-significant” in this sentence fosters sloppy thinking. If the value is small, that is evidence for biological unimportance. As the CIs get smaller, this evidence gets _stronger_. Eventually, the effect will become “significant”, while the evidence for unimportance continues to get stronger. 
* The effect of the interaction between condition and sex on all four traits was negative (but nearly zero) and non-significant, suggesting that the reduction in the extent of sexual dimorphism due to condition was not biologically relevant.
