***Where everything is located***

The original data set "MP_SpeciesStarvation_Clean.csv" is located in the main Dpro_CD_SD repository. 

Data clean up and exploratory plots are in the script "DataCleaning.R" in the main repository 

Multivariate Mixed effects model using lmer and the multivariate fixed effect only model using lm, both for our analysis of the leg traits and body size are located in the script "MixedModels.R" in the main repository. All associated analysis are located in this script. The "MixedModels.R" script uses the the data sets Dprol_wide_dummy.rds and Dprol_long_dummy.rds generated via the DataCleaning.R script. 

The multivariate fixed effects model using lm for the comparison of leg traits and wing area is located in the script "Leg_vs_Wing_Final.R" in the main repository. All analyses discussed in the write-up are included in this script. It uses the Dprol_wing.rds file generated in the "DataCleaning.R" script.

Our final write-up  'Abass_VanBakel_708_FinalPaper' is located in the main repository.
