Created preliminary linear model that makes a very simplified visualization of data, that will be replaced by a more advanced mixed model.

**BMB**: this should probably be a *little* more detailed? (What was the model?)

We could calculate PC1 and then divide all other measurements by PC1
Alternatively, we could just use the thorax measurement itself as the divisor

Calculated principle components analysis for male and female trait data

Looked at loadings to see what component contributed most to observed variation
